# Synchornized

## Single check lock

Performance issue

## Double check lock

## Drawback

Singleton can be destroyed by reflection

# Final and Static
## Enum & Interface

Creation of enum is guaranteed to be thread safe.
All interface variables are implicitly modified with *final* and *static*, so they are thread safe.

## drawback

Initialized when first loaded

## Static helper class
