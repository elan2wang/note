ADF - Augmented Dickey Fuller test is unit root test for stationarity. Unit roots can cause unpredicatable results in time series anlysis. 

### Statistic Basic

#### Variance
\\[
V\left(X\right) = E[\left(X - E[X]\right)^2] = E[X^2] - E[X]^2
\\]

#### Covariance
\\[
cov\left(X, Y\right) = E[\left(X - E[X] \right)\left(Y - E[Y]\right)] = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y]
\\]
\\[
cov\left(X, X\right) = V\left(X\right)
\\]

#### Correlation
[Corrlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient) is a normalized Covariance, whose value range is [-1, 1]. A value of +1 is total positive linear correlation, 0 is no linear correlation, and âˆ’1 is total negative linear correlation
\\[
\rho\left(X, Y\right) = \frac{cov\left(X, Y\right)}{\sqrt{V\left(X\right)}\sqrt{V\left(Y\right)}} = \frac{E[XY] - E[X]E[Y]}{\sqrt{E[X^2] - E[X]^2}\sqrt{E[Y^2] - E[Y]^2}}
\\]

### Hypothesis Testing

#### Null Hypothesis
The [null hypothesis](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/null-hypothesis/), H0 is the commonly accepted fact; it is the opposite of the alternate hypothesis. Researchers work to reject, nullify or disprove the null hypothesis. Researchers come up with an alternate hypothesis, one that they think explains a phenomenon, and then work to reject the null hypothesis.

#### Unit Root
A [unit root](https://www.statisticshowto.com/unit-root/)(also called a unit root process or a difference stationary process) test is a stochastic trend in a time series, sometimes called a "random walk with drift"; If a time series has a unit root, it shows a systematic pattern that is unpredictable.

#### P-Value
A [p value](https://www.statisticshowto.com/p-value/) is used in hypothesis testing to help support or reject [null hypothesis](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/null-hypothesis/). The p value is the evidence against a null hypothesis. The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence that you should reject null hypothesis. 

#### Likelihood-Ratio Test
The [Likelihood-Ratio test](https://www.statisticshowto.com/likelihood-ratio-tests/) (sometimes called the likelihood-ratio chi-squared test) is a hypothesis test that helps you choose the "best" model between two nested models.
