## Stationarity
### Strict Stationarity
\\[
[x_t, x_{t+k}] \sim Dist\left(\mu, \sigma^2\right)
\\]
\\[
[x_{t+\tau}, x_{t+\tau+k}] \sim Dist\left(\mu, \sigma^2\right)
\\]
Strict stationarity should satisfy above assumption, as it is rarely observed in natural world, in analytics, it is universally accepted to use stationarity to describe covariance stationarity.

### Covariance Stationarity
Covariance (weak-form) stationarity assumption
* Constant $\mu$
* Constant $\sigma^2$
* $Cov\left(x_n, x_{n+k}\right) = Cov\left(x_m, x_{m+k}\right)$

White noise satisfy the weak-form stationarity, as:
* $\mu=0$
* $\sigma^2$ is constant
* $Cov\left(x_n, x_{n+k}\right) = Corr\left(x_m, x_{m+k}\right)\sigma_1\sigma_2=0$
