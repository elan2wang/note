####The Road not Taken
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both,  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And Looked down one as far as I could  
To Where it bent in the undergrowth;  

Then took the other, as just as fair,  
And having perhaps the better claim,  
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;

Though as for that the passing there  
Has worn them really about the same,  
And both that moring equally lay  
In leaves no step had trodden black.  

Oh, I kept the first for another day!  
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,  
I doubted if I should ever come back.  

I shall be telling this with a sigh  
Somewhere ages and ages hence:  

Two roads diverged in a wood, And I——  
I took the one less traveled by,  
And that has made all the difference.
