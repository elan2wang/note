## [Endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness)

Endianness is the order or sequence of bytes of a word of digital data in computer memory. 

- Big-endian stores the most significant byte of a word at the smallest memory address and the least significant byte at the largest;
- Little-endian stores the least significant byte at the smallest memory address.
